Basically design a rate limiter service, that can be pinged by actual web services before executing ops.
This rate limiter ping must be lightning fast, so it don't mess with the speed too much. Not that this solution does not exist in the world, I am just letting my mind run wild and do a small project is all.
Build barebones ping first in TypeScript. Later port the same in Go and Java.
TS cause, that is what I am coding currntly in. Go/Java port for employability, interview showcase.
